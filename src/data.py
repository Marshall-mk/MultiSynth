"""
Data loading and generation for MultiSynthSR training.
Includes comprehensive k-space artifact simulation and Physics-based PSF blurring.

This module simulates the MRI acquisition pipeline to generate synthetic Low-Resolution (LR) images
from High-Resolution (HR) ground truth. It models the physical degradation process including:
1.  **Slice Profile & Point Spread Function (PSF):** The physical blurring caused by RF excitation profiles and signal decay.
2.  **B1 Field Inhomogeneity:** Bias fields that cause smooth intensity variations.
3.  **Contrast Variation:** Gamma correction to simulate different T1/T2 weightings.
4.  **K-Space Artifacts:** Motion ghosting and spikes in the frequency domain.
5.  **Sampling Limits:** Resolution loss via FFT cropping (simulating limited k-space acquisition).

    """
    Simulates the physical blurring caused by the MRI scanner's slice selection profile and in-plane sampling.

    **MRI Physical Representation:**
    In a real MRI scanner, a 2D slice is not a perfect geometric plane. It has a thickness determined
    by the Radio Frequency (RF) excitation pulse.
    - **Through-Plane (Slice Direction):** The RF pulse excites spins within a "slab." The sensitivity profile
      across this slab is rarely a perfect rectangle (Boxcar). It is often trapezoidal or Gaussian due to
      hardware limits on the RF pulse duration (truncated Sinc pulses). This causes "Partial Volume Effects"
      where signal from adjacent tissues bleeds into the slice.
    - **In-Plane (Phase/Frequency Directions):** Blurring occurs due to T2* relaxation during readout
      and finite sampling windows, typically modeled as a Point Spread Function (PSF).

    This class replaces generic Gaussian blurring with physically programmable kernels to accurately
    model these distinct behaviors.

            (transition region). Represents the imperfect sharp cutoff of the RF pulse.

    surface coils. This causes low-frequency intensity variations where some parts of the
    brain appear brighter or darker than others, despite having the same tissue type.

    Args:
        bias_field_std (float): Standard deviation of the bias field coefficients.

    **MRI Physical Representation:**
    MRI scanners are configured by technicians to acquire data at specific resolutions.
    - **Isotropic:** High-resolution 3D scans (e.g., MP-RAGE) often have 1x1x1 mm voxels.
    - **Anisotropic:** Fast clinical 2D scans (e.g., T2-weighted turbo spin echo) typically
